# Welcome to PunisherX
This is a comprehensive punishment system that offers warnings, mutes, bans, IP bans (including temporary ones), and kicks. With the Check function, you can quickly check the current penalties imposed on a player. The plugin includes customizable templates for punishment reasons, making it easier to issue them quickly. Our PunisherX plugin offers a complete message file that allows modification and translation of all messages with full support for Minimessage. Additionally, the plugin has a detailed configuration file with many useful settings. The plugin is optimized for Paper servers and their forks, such as Pufferfish and Purpur. It supports both MySQL/MariaDB for synchronization between multiple servers and a local SQLite database for high performance.
