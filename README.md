# Proudly Introducing PunisherX

PunisherX is a comprehensive punishment system offering commands like `kick`, `warn`, `mute`, `jail`, `ban`, and `ban-ip` ‚Äî with both temporary and permanent options.  
With support commands like `/check`, `/history`, and `/banlist`, administrators can quickly review a player's current punishment status or browse a full list of banned users.

Designed for speed and convenience, PunisherX includes customizable templates for punishment reasons, allowing quick and consistent enforcement.  
It also offers a complete message file for full translation and customization, supporting **MiniMessage**, Legacy, and plain Minecraft formatting.  
A detailed configuration file and support for various database types (MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL for multi-server sync, and SQLite/H2 for high-performance standalone use) make it flexible and production-ready.
