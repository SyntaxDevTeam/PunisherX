# Changelog

## [1.5.0] - 2025-10-04

### Functional changes:
- [x] **Added support for the latest version 1.21.9**
    * Added version compatibility management
    * Added appropriate checks and methods to maintain compatibility between Minecraft versions 1.20.6 and 1.21.9
- [x] Updated placeholder formatting. Changed from `{}` to `<>`
    - Twice the messaging performance by using the built-in TagResolver for the MiniMessage format
    - **Attention!** Due to the use of the MiniMessage format for Placeholders, it is necessary to work with the previous version of the language files.

      After starting the server, the following commands are required:
        * `/langfix` - for a quick update to the new version of the messages_xx.yml file
        * `/prx reload` or restart the server to reload the correct placeholders
        * You can also skip the previous steps and simply delete the `lang` folder from the PunisherX directory. The plugin will generate a default file with the latest version.
      > Using `/prx reload` does not guarantee reloading messages downloaded "permanently" at plugin startup

      > Never use `/reload` commands to attempt to reload a plugin. This can cause serious performance issues for the plugin and the entire server.
- [x] Added "all" argument for use instead of player name in `/kick` command to kick all players at once.
- [x] The config.yml file has been rebuilt to be more intuitive and adapted to the latest improvements.
- [x] Added the ability to set an alias for the setspawn command
- [x] Full integration with the getSmartMessage method providing greater flexibility in notification settings for kick, mute, ban, jail, etc. commands.

  Usage example in messages_en.yml:
    ```YAML
   broadcast: "<dark_gray>Player <gray><player></gray> was jailed for <gray><reason></gray> for <gray><time></gray></dark_gray>"
    ```
  lub
    ```YAML
       broadcast:
          - "<dark_gray>*************** Your Server Name *************** </dark_gray>"
          - ""
          - "<red>   Player <white><player></white> was jailed</red>"
          - "   Reason: <white><reason></white>"
          - "   Duration: <white><time></white>"
          - ""
          - "<dark_gray>*************************************************** </dark_gray>"
    ```

    storage: "file"
