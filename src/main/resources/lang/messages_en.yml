# Message formatting:
# You can use MiniMessage and Legacy (Minecraft) formatting.
# Examples of how to use MiniMessage: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html
# Do not mix formats in one message. If you use Legacy, do not insert MiniMessage formatting, otherwise only the latter will be used.
